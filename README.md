### ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction ✈️
## Our project focuses on predicting flight delays in American Airlines using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle. Data included information regarding arrival time, scheduled time, weather information, and cancellation reasons. The data was cleaned thoroughly and we dropped 13 unnecessary columns for our data analysis.
- The objective of this project is to predict flight delays in advance.
### Cleaning
Original file size 500+ MB which includes 14 airlines and each has at least 60k data
We chose American Airlines Lnc. to make the dataset smaller so we can run the code properly. We used SQL to drop the columns and clean the data as per requirements.

### Visualizations
To create visualizations we used Tableau and determined what airports have the highest and lowest rate of cancelations using a Pie chart. Bar chart helped us to visualize which day of the week has the maximum number of flight cancelations. 

### Machine learning
After plenty of trial and error, we decided to use a neural network model that utilizes the make circles module from sk.learn.
The model yielded the highest accuracy of all our attempts. We were able to achieve 97% accuracy with this model.
